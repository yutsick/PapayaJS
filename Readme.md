# Project Setup

This project uses `gulp`, `pug` and `scss` to create pages.

## Project Setup
First of all make sure you have `gulp-cli ` installed globally, if not then use the following command to install it 
`npm install --global gulp-cli`

## Run project

Now type the following command to run it 
`gulp dev`   // this will run the project on 3000 port

index.pg page will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Note: For other route you need to attach .html as well to access the page like in our case 
[http://localhost:3000/policy.html](http://localhost:3000/policy.html)
